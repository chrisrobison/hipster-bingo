#Hipster Bingo: BINGO cards you print out and take to parties. Each square is a stereotype of typical partygoers.

#Welcome
Welcome to Hipster BINGO! The secret BINGO game you play at partys, especially ones you don't really want to be at.  

A Hipster BINGO card is not filled with numbers. Instead, each square contains a stereotype of a person who is likely to attend the party.  Spot that stereotype in real life and mark that spot!  Fun to play with a girlfriend or spouse at dreaded holiday parties.  Or play with friends for the next round of drinks! You will be surprised how quickly you can reach a BINGO.

All of the stereotypes are contained in an javascript array in the file 'bingo.js'.  To add a stereotype, simply add a properly quoted string into the array.  The card generator will look for images in the 'img' directory with the same name as the string, only with any non-alphanumeric characters converted to '-'. Oh, and they need to be png's.
